  <h5>Meet Rajendra Kumhar</h5>
  <p>Rajendra Kumhar ji is the son of the padmashree award winner Mohanlal Chaturbhuj Kumhar. He has been practicing the art of molela terracotta for 18 years now! Being an artisan came naturally to him. While he attended school and got proper academic education, he spent a large chunk of his childhood watching his father work and eventually adopted the craft and decided to take it forward.</p>

    <h5>LIFESTYLE</h5>
    <p>Rajendra Ji comes off as a very down-to-earth person who takes great work in his pride. Even when he spoke to us we could see him fiddling with a semi-dry pot. To the untrained eye, the pot looked finished and perfected! But he continued to run a soft white stone pebble over it to polish the surface. When asked about his daily routine, he replied very nonchalantly that work happens when there is motivation, inspiration, and requirement. There is no morning prayer before starting work. At a stretch, he might sit crouched in front of his piece with his tools and work for long hours. But when inspiration is scarce, he prefers to take walks around his house and on the village streets to clear his head.​Rajendra Ji used to play around his father’s workshop quite often as a child. Sitting on the wheel or just imitating his father with clay. A big part of his childhood was spent in his father's studio, he says and we quote, “I don’t even know when all these fun and games became my profession. It was all so natural!”</p>
